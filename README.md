# ANN-blood-cells

!

This repository contains my work for the first homework assignment in the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course (2024-2025). The task is to develop a multi-class classification model to classify 96x96 RGB images of blood cells into eight classes, each representing a distinct cell state. This project involves exploring and implementing artificial neural network models to achieve accurate classification.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Provided dataset of labeled blood cell images.
- **Code**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Results**: Stores model performance metrics and analysis.

## Objective
To apply deep learning techniques to accurately classify blood cell images, contributing to advancements in medical image analysis.
